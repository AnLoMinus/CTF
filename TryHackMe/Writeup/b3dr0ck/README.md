#### Server trouble in Bedrock.

## Task 1  Yabba-Dabba-Doo

### Fred Flintstone   &   Barney Rubble!

##### Barney is setting up the ABC webserver, and trying to use TLS certs to secure connections, but he's having trouble. Here's what we know...

- He was able to establish nginx on port 80,  redirecting to a custom TLS webserver on port 4040
- There is a TCP socket listening with a simple service to help retrieve TLS credential files (client key & certificate)
- There is another TCP (TLS) helper service listening for authorized connections using files obtained from the above service
- Can you find all the Easter eggs?

##### Please allow an extra few minutes for the VM to fully startupï»¿.
